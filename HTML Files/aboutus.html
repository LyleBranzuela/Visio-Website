            <p class="aboutus-content1-font-style">The company IMIN joined Visio since 2008, the time where the film “Journey to the Center of Earth” was made 3D, giving the rise to 3D films. IMIN was created since 1999, starting out with a small theatre building in North Wellington. If you want to watch various films from 3D to 2D, IMIN is definitely a good choice for you as IMIN is spread throughout New Zealand.</p>	
            <p class="aboutus-content1-font-style">IMIN contacted Visio and suggested an idea that our company, that was mainly making glass products at the time to invest on glasses, as glasses were becoming more and more influential. With IMIN’s passion to make the audience’s experience always better than it was before, this mindset is great for always having the consumer’s likes and dislikes in our minds.</p>

            <p class="aboutus-content1-font-style">What stood out the most for Visio was Inpsyche’s talent of creating new and fresh ideas. Although they are a newly formed team, every member has a lot of potential to grow well and succeed in their respective areas. Adding the fact that the team was passionate about what they are doing, Inpsyche was definitely a good addition to the Visio family.</p>
